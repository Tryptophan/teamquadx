				<h1>Happy Halloween!</h1>
				<p>10/31/14</p>
				<p>Happy Halloween, everybody! We don&apos;t know about you, but everyone on QUADX will be having a great time this evening stuffing ourselves full of candy and trick or treating. Not only have we been preppping for Hallowween, but we&apos;ve been making lots of progress on the robot- we now have a working manipulator, and have been playing full rounds! </p>
				<p>Additionally, we were out volunteering yesterday with the Side By Side Kids organization for the first time. Side By Side Kids is an after school program  committed to tutoring struggling elementary school students in any and all fields. Today, however, the homework help was put on hold, with the Fall Festival occurring instead! We ran activities for the kids, including a &quot;Cupcake Walk&quot; and various games in which they won candy as prizes. By the time the festival was over, we&apos;d had a lot of fun meeting the kids we would be tutoring, and they were super hyped up on sugar and ready to go home. </p>

But this week hasn&apos;t been just preparing ourselves for Halloween. Our manipulator now works consistently, and we&apos;ve even been able to play a full round. </p>

				<h1>Code.org Workshop</h1>
				<p>10/18/14</p>
				<p>Today our software team was out in East Austin at Huston-Tillotson University. We were helping to host a workshop with code.org, a company committed to increasing programming skills for students and adults alike. This workshop was for teachers interested in introducing programming to elementary schoolers. We presented to them the visual programming- based curriculum, and ran them through mock session of the &quot;Unplugged&quot; activities in which the children learn concepts such as loops and functions away from the computer. The singing of &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; by the Beatles to relate the chorus to the definition of a function was especially entertaining! Finally, we discussed the challenges that could arise when trying to implement coding into elementary schools, such as unwilling districts and the lack of funding. During the brainstorming for solutions, we gladly provided input from a student&rsquo;s point of view, and as a group we came up with some great ideas. It was an enlightening experience to see that our teachers are continuously learning and motivated towards improving our futures.</p>

				<h1>First Build Day</h1>
				<p>9/20/14</p>
				<p>Today was the first build day of the season.  Two weeks into the season, we have finally had a chance to work for 8 hours straight.  Like any other build day, we invited rookie teams in the community, including the Texas School for the Deaf and the Canyon Ridge Middle School team Eagles Experience, to come and get help from us and take advantage of our parts closet and workshop.  Josh, Jacob and Linnea held a GitHub workshop to on how to use Git and GitHub and how to set up their own repositories. We also took our team pictures, which you can now see on &quot;The Team&quot; page of the website. </p>

				<h1>Vandegrift Kickoff</h1>
				<p>9/6/14</p>
				<p>Today, we hosted the Central Texas FTC Kickoff. Over 400 people first joined in on team bonding activities which were lead in part by Lizzy, Linnea, and Sahil. The game for the 2014-2015 year was then released at 11 and teams immediately started brainstorming designs for robots. We held a &quot;Rookie Workshop&quot; to teach the rookie teams in attendance how to be successful in marketing, hardware, and software.  After a long day of bonding and brainstorming, we all went to the ViperBots pool party where we relaxed and had a ton of fun with our team members and fellow ViperBot teams.</p>

				<p>We are so excited for the upcoming year and cannot wait to get started!!</p>

				<h1>Powering Through the Last Week</h1>
				<p>4/16/14</p>
				<p>So here we are, the final week before Worlds. We've been working like crazy to prepare ever since Supers, but now we're kicking it into overdrive. 

				On Saturday, we had both Iron Eagles teams and Disgruntled Robots over as our final "tune-ups" before Worlds. We all worked tirelessly the whole day, and it was a great chance to work hard together on our robots. 

				This week, we've been at the Robot Room pretty much whenever we have time- from the crack of dawn to as late as we can stay after school. We're working to finish touchups on our autonomous so that it's rock solid, and getting in as much driver practice as humanly possible. 

				As a detox, we're planning some fun final team bonding activities for our day off Friday, as well as hopefully Monday. We just can't wait!</p>

			<h1>We're Books (and Robotics) Nerds and Proud</h1>
			<p>4/5/2014</p>
			<p>Today, we went to the book worms of QUADX&apos;s favorite place in the world- Barnes and Noble. We were helping to raise money for our library by driving around our robot- that is, of course, when we weren&apos;t off looking at books. Any purchases made this evening benefited the library, so honestly, we were helping simply by getting books. :) Nevertheless, we had a ton of fun driving around our robot for the people there, and talking about FTC. When we&apos;d finished up at the fundraiser, we headed out for some Five Guys with some friends from 6209. Our &quot;dinner dates&quot; with them are always a ton of fun, and this one was no different!</p>

			<h1>Community Outings</h1>
			<p>3/28/2014</p>
			<p>After Supers, we took a week off from working on the robot, just to relax before getting ready for Worlds. But just because we can't go to the robot room doesn't mean we aren't out in the community! On Thursday, we went to the Giddens Stem Expo out in Leander. We drove K9 around for the people there, and let the kids try a hand at driving our robot. It was a lot of fun to watch these kids drive our robot- they were doing a bang-up job! We also talked to some of the parents about what we do as an organization, and explained FIRST to them. </p>
			<p>Another awesome person we met was  Mr. Tony Dale, our State Representative. His daughters go to school in LISD, and he heard about QUADX going to worlds! It was amazing to talk to him about everything we've done, and we promised to send him some pictures from Worlds. </p>

			<p>SXSW was also in town a over March Break, and when we weren&apos;t checking out the Occulus Rift demo or listening to some awesome music, we were hosting a booth at the Interactive conference. All day Saturday and Sunday, we talked to SXSW-goers about QUADX, the ViperBots program, as well as FIRST and FTC. We ran mock competitions for them, which was a huge hit- everyone loved seeing these awesome robots!</p>
			<p>Finally, just last Friday we were at River Ridge Elementary, raising money so we could fund our trip to Worlds. We set up an arena at the dance the school was hosting, and let kids and parents alike drive the robot for a donation. For those thirsty from dancing, we also sold water. Showing off our robot was a ton of fun, and as a bonus we raised $850 dollars to go to our trip! </p>

			<p>And we're not finished yet! QUADX will be at the Austin Mini Maker Faire in May, as well as the Vandegrift-hosted Viperpalooza. By then, we will have our new team members, so it'll be a great way both to spread FIRST to the community, as well as bond as a team.</p>

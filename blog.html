			<h1>Code.org Workshop</h1>
			<p>10/18/14</p>
			<p>Today our software team was out in East Austin at Huston-Tillotson University. We were helping to host a workshop with code.org, a company committed to increasing programming skills for students and adults alike. This workshop was for teachers interested in introducing programming to elementary schoolers. We presented to them the visual programming- based curriculum, and ran them through mock session of the &quot;Unplugged&quot; activities in which the children learn concepts such as loops and functions away from the computer. The singing of &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; by the Beatles to relate the chorus to the definition of a function was especially entertaining! Finally, we discussed the challenges that could arise when trying to implement coding into elementary schools, such as unwilling districts and the lack of funding. During the brainstorming for solutions, we gladly provided input from a student&rsquo;s point of view, and as a group we came up with some great ideas. It was an enlightening experience to see that our teachers are continuously learning and motivated towards improving our futures.</p>

			<h1>First Build Day</h1>
			<p>9/20/14</p>
			<p>Today was the first build day of the season.  Two weeks into the season, we have finally had a chance to work for 8 hours straight.  Like any other build day, we invited rookie teams in the community, including the Texas School for the Deaf and the Canyon Ridge Middle School team Eagles Experience, to come and get help from us and take advantage of our parts closet and workshop.  Josh, Jacob and Linnea held a GitHub workshop to on how to use Git and GitHub and how to set up their own repositories. We also took our team pictures, which you can now see on &quot;The Team&quot; page of the website. </p>

			<h1>Vandegrift Kickoff</h1>
			<p>9/6/14</p>
			<p>Today, we hosted the Central Texas FTC Kickoff. Over 400 people first joined in on team bonding activities which were lead in part by Lizzy, Linnea, and Sahil. The game for the 2014-2015 year was then released at 11 and teams immediately started brainstorming designs for robots. We held a &quot;Rookie Workshop&quot; to teach the rookie teams in attendance how to be successful in marketing, hardware, and software.  After a long day of bonding and brainstorming, we all went to the ViperBots pool party where we relaxed and had a ton of fun with our team members and fellow ViperBot teams.</p>

			<p>We are so excited for the upcoming year and cannot wait to get started!!</p>

			<h1>Powering Through the Last Week</h1>
			<p>4/16/14</p>
			<p>So here we are, the final week before Worlds. We've been working like crazy to prepare ever since Supers, but now we're kicking it into overdrive. 

			On Saturday, we had both Iron Eagles teams and Disgruntled Robots over as our final "tune-ups" before Worlds. We all worked tirelessly the whole day, and it was a great chance to work hard together on our robots. 

			This week, we've been at the Robot Room pretty much whenever we have time- from the crack of dawn to as late as we can stay after school. We're working to finish touchups on our autonomous so that it's rock solid, and getting in as much driver practice as humanly possible. 

			As a detox, we're planning some fun final team bonding activities for our day off Friday, as well as hopefully Monday. We just can't wait!</p>

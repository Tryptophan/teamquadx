				<h1>Regionals Weekend</h1>
				<p>2/21/2015</p>
				<p>Our Regionals Championship started off great by getting out of school on Friday to drive down to San Antonio for setup, inspections, and judging. We arrived with a good 4 hours to set up before judging, and by 7 o'clock we had finished up for the night! If only getting food after that had been as easy as preparing for competition... funnily enough, none of the restaurants in town were too excited to feed 60 hungry teenagers. Nevertheless, we finally were fed and well(ish) rested for competition the next day. We started Saturday off great by scoring a 533 with our alliance partner, keeping within the 500-600's all of qualifications. We ended up undefeated and 2nd due to RP points, picking High PHidelity and Orobourus as partners. We made it to what we called &quot;Murphy's Finals&quot; because everything that could go wrong, did. During the first match, we disconected and despooled one of our pulleys in the process. We had to call a timeout, and our oponents (Dark Horse, Chrome, and Philobots) showed amazing gracious professionalism by using their timeout as well. The next two rounds, Chrome lost their battery, one of Dark Horse's driver cut his hand open, and our wiring got messed up from our time disconnected earlier. We emerged from probably the most eventful Division Finals ever victorious, and went up against Stryke and the Elemonators in the Event Finals. We won the event, throughout having 5 matches over 700 points! We were super close to setting a new world record, but were really proud of our success. Afterwards, during awards, we watched an amazing performance of the interpreter for the Texas School for the Deaf sign out It's All About That Bass, which was entertaining to watch. We got 2nd Place Inspire, and our very own Lizzy Patterson was nominated as a semi-finalist for the Dean's List Award! At the end of the day, we had qualified for Super Regionals, along with sister teams Stryke and Orobourus. We're sad to see Viperbots Big Fang Fury, Snakebyte, and Venoms' seasons end, but are super excited for the 3 teams that qualified, and can't wait to see everybody at Super Regionals in 3 weeks!</p>

				<h1>Special Olympics and Team Bonding</h1>
				<p>2/7/2015</p>
				<p>This weekend, QUADX continued the tradition of volunteering at the Texas Special Olympics (SOTX). For a couple hours, we helped people with special needs in their bowling competition, making sure they got up to bowl their turn and cheering them on. After two great games, the bowlers were done and had their awards ceremony. We always love volunteering at the Special Olympics, because everyone has a ton of fun- the bowlers and the volunteers alike! Once the event was over, we headed out to Hopdoddy's, probably the best burger place in town. We had to wait a whole hour in line for these amazing burgers, but we spent it all hanging out and talking. After <del> we'd died and gone to heaven</del> eaten, we all headed over to Tyler's house for some more team bonding. We hung out, and watched one of the best movies ever- Monty Python and the Holy Grail. With competition coming up soon, it was really nice to spend a day volunteering and just relaxing as a team and as a group of friends!</p>

				<h1>Harlandale Double Qualifier</h1>
				<p>1/31/2015</p>
				<p>Our second qualifier of the season, we were back out in San Antonio at Harlandale High School. Having already qualified, we saw this as a great opportunity to test out our new robot and make some new friends! It turns out we would have plenty of time to do so, as the high school we were out experienced power outages for the first 3 hours. During that time, we hung out with other FTC teams, and even got to explain how we built the robot to many FLL teams that were competiting this weekend as well. When Qualifications began, we found some minor issues with our robot, but we were happy for them to arise- now we know what to fix before Regionals. We were 1st Captain, and chose the Shambots and Blackout Enigma as our alliance partners. With such a great alliance, we won the competition! We also won the Think Award and 2nd Place Inspire, and within the other division, our sister team 6210 Viperbots Stryke won 1st Place Inspire and Winning Alliance 1st pick, thus qualifying for Regionals! We're super proud of both our accomplishments and those of all the teams that were there. Hope to see everyone at Regionals!</p>

				<h1>First Qualifier</h1>
				<p>12/6/2014</p>
				<p>For our first Regional qualifier of the season, QUADX and all the ViperBots teams had an amazing competition! Despite the fact that we had to get up at 4 in the morning to drive all the way to San Antonio, we were super excited for the competition, rocking both judging and our qualification matches. Throughout qualifiers, we experienced some minor pulley issues, but had a high score of 392 points. Additionally, we drove around our &quot;trollbot&quot;, which loaded with our gyro stabilization code, to connect other teams with our code via GitHub. We finished 1st in qualifiers, and chose 4546 SnakeByte and 9036 from Reagan Robotics as our alliance partners, and were first pitted against the Shambots during semi&apos;s. Finals ended up being ViperBots vs. Viperbots, with our alliance beating 4545 Ouroboros, 6209 Venom and Control F8.  As for awards, we were nominated for every single award except for Motivate, and also got 3rd place Inspire. With 4546 winning Inspire, 6209 winning Think, and 4545 winning Innovate, all ViperBot teams in attendance have advanced to the Regionals competition! Congratulations to all ViperBot teams, and to all those in attendance!</p>

				<p>After a day straight of stuffing ourselves full of turkey and pie, Black Friday is a day for shopping, right? Wrong! QUADX was back in the Robot Room getting ready for the San Antonio Qualifier. We can now score in the center goal, and our robot is now adorned with Lexan and our team number and sponsors. With a quick Freebirds lunch break with our friends, we worked hard throughout the day. To end the day, we went out to see Interstellar as a team. We&apos;re sad to see the end of our break, but can&apos;t wait to get back to work, and are getting super pumped up for competition next week!</p>

				<p>11/15/2014</p>
				<p>It was 7 AM on a cold and rainy Saturday morning&hellip; and QUADX was out preparing the Vandegrift High School cafeteria for the 3rd Annual ViperBots Open. With 29 teams in attendance, from teams just a couple miles down the road to all the way from San Antonio, we all came out to test our robots in a competition environment. It&apos; amazing to see the progress other teams have made, the ingenious ideas people are coming up with! Not only was it cool to see what everyone else was doing, it was great feedback for our own team to see what we need to get done before our first real qualifier. We&apos;re pretty good at scoring balls, getting the high score in the qualification rounds of 284 points, and we won the award for the quickest to score a ball in the teleop phase. For 11 hours we were at the high school competing in the tournament, making it to the semifinals, and then, when the entire competition was over, breaking down the arenas and tidying up. After such a long day, we went out with friends from other teams to get some well-earned frozen yogurt. While we&apos;re now all super exhausted, it was a very exciting and educational day!</p>

Not only have we been preppping for Hallowween, but we&apos;ve been making lots of progress on the robot- we now have a working manipulator, and have been playing full rounds! </p>
				<p>Additionally, we were out volunteering yesterday with the Side By Side Kids organization for the first time. Side By Side Kids is an after school program  committed to tutoring struggling elementary school students in any and all fields. Today, however, the homework help was put on hold, with the Fall Festival occurring instead! We ran activities for the kids, including a &quot;Cupcake Walk&quot; and various games in which they won candy as prizes. By the time the festival was over, we&apos;d had a lot of fun meeting the kids we would be tutoring, and they were super hyped up on sugar and ready to go home. </p>

				<h1>Code.org Workshop</h1>
				<p>10/18/14</p>
				<p>Today our software team was out in East Austin at Huston-Tillotson University. We were helping to host a workshop with code.org, a company committed to increasing programming skills for students and adults alike. This workshop was for teachers interested in introducing programming to elementary schoolers. We presented to them the visual programming- based curriculum, and ran them through mock session of the &quot;Unplugged&quot; activities in which the children learn concepts such as loops and functions away from the computer. The singing of &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; by the Beatles to relate the chorus to the definition of a function was especially entertaining! Finally, we discussed the challenges that could arise when trying to implement coding into elementary schools, such as unwilling districts and the lack of funding. During the brainstorming for solutions, we gladly provided input from a student&rsquo;s point of view, and as a group we came up with some great ideas. It was an enlightening experience to see that our teachers are continuously learning and motivated towards improving our futures.</p>

				<p>Today, we hosted the Central Texas FTC Kickoff. Over 400 people first joined in on team bonding activities which were lead in part by Lizzy, Linnea, and Sahil.

We held a &quot;Rookie Workshop&quot; to teach the rookie teams in attendance how to be successful in marketing, hardware, and software.  After a long day of bonding and brainstorming, we all went to the ViperBots pool party where we relaxed and had a ton of fun with our team members and fellow ViperBot teams.</p>

				<p>We are so excited for the upcoming year and cannot wait to get started!!</p>

				<h1>Vandegrift Kickoff</h1>
				<p>9/6/14</p>
				<p>Today, we hosted the Central Texas FTC Kickoff. Over 400 people first joined in on team bonding activities which were lead in part by Lizzy, Linnea, and Sahil.

				<h1>Powering Through the Last Week</h1>
				<p>4/16/14</p>
				<p>So here we are, the final week before Worlds. We've been working like crazy to prepare ever since Supers, but now we're kicking it into overdrive. 

				On Saturday, we had both Iron Eagles teams and Disgruntled Robots over as our final "tune-ups" before Worlds. We all worked tirelessly the whole day, and it was a great chance to work hard together on our robots. 

				This week, we've been at the Robot Room pretty much whenever we have time- from the crack of dawn to as late as we can stay after school. We're working to finish touchups on our autonomous so that it's rock solid, and getting in as much driver practice as humanly possible. 

				As a detox, we're planning some fun final team bonding activities for our day off Friday, as well as hopefully Monday. We just can't wait!</p>

				<h1>We're Books (and Robotics) Nerds and Proud</h1>
				<p>4/5/2014</p>
				<p>Today, we went to the book worms of QUADX&apos;s favorite place in the world- Barnes and Noble. We were helping to raise money for our library by driving around our robot- that is, of course, when we weren&apos;t off looking at books. Any purchases made this evening benefited the library, so honestly, we were helping simply by getting books. :) Nevertheless, we had a ton of fun driving around our robot for the people there, and talking about FTC. When we&apos;d finished up at the fundraiser, we headed out for some Five Guys with some friends from 6209. Our &quot;dinner dates&quot; with them are always a ton of fun, and this one was no different!</p>

				<h1>Community Outings</h1>
				<p>3/28/2014</p>
				<p>After Supers, we took a week off from working on the robot, just to relax before getting ready for Worlds. But just because we can't go to the robot room doesn't mean we aren't out in the community! On Thursday, we went to the Giddens Stem Expo out in Leander. We drove K9 around for the people there, and let the kids try a hand at driving our robot. It was a lot of fun to watch these kids drive our robot- they were doing a bang-up job! We also talked to some of the parents about what we do as an organization, and explained FIRST to them. </p>
				<p>Another awesome person we met was  Mr. Tony Dale, our State Representative. His daughters go to school in LISD, and he heard about QUADX going to worlds! It was amazing to talk to him about everything we've done, and we promised to send him some pictures from Worlds. </p>

				<p>SXSW was also in town a over March Break, and when we weren&apos;t checking out the Occulus Rift demo or listening to some awesome music, we were hosting a booth at the Interactive conference. All day Saturday and Sunday, we talked to SXSW-goers about QUADX, the ViperBots program, as well as FIRST and FTC. We ran mock competitions for them, which was a huge hit- everyone loved seeing these awesome robots!</p>
				<p>Finally, just last Friday we were at River Ridge Elementary, raising money so we could fund our trip to Worlds. We set up an arena at the dance the school was hosting, and let kids and parents alike drive the robot for a donation. For those thirsty from dancing, we also sold water. Showing off our robot was a ton of fun, and as a bonus we raised $850 dollars to go to our trip! </p>

				<h1>The Voyages of Melvin the Duck and Other Supers Stories</h1>
				<p>3/1/2014</p>
				<p>After Regionals, QUAD X received Melvin the rubber duck, who&apos;s usually given to the ViperBot team that makes it to Worlds. But because we were the only team to advance to Supers, we were awarded him. We were honored to receive this duck, who has been signed by Woody Flowers and traveled to St. Louis twice already, and he received a place of honor right on top of the brick we received from 7161 BFF at the Connally Qualifier. Of course, we brought our new favorite rubber duck to Supers as what we would hope to be a good luck charm. We took him everywhere, from the pits to finals and the restaurants we ate out at.</p>
				<p>It turns out he&apos;s good luck after all! We were 1st and undefeated during Qualifications, the Finalist Alliance Captain, 2nd Place Inspire, the winner of Innovate as well as finalists for Motivate and Think. In short, we qualified for Worlds 3 separate times, and were 3rd in the South Super Regionals! We&apos;re honored to take Melvin on his 3rd trip to Worlds, and we&apos;re equally (if not more so) honored to have worked with such amazing teams. We had an amazing alliance during finals, with Monkey Madness and Disgruntled Robots being awesome guys to kick some bot with! :D Congrats to all teams who made it to such an intense level of competition, and congrats to team 92 Junior Bomb Squad for winning the tournament!</p>
				<p>All of Friday, we were cheered on by all the ViperBots who took the day off school to come down on the Spirit Bus. They dressed in gold and glitter, and came to cheer us on! We pretty much gave them the flag and some posters, and let them loose upon the stands.Without them, we wouldn&apos;t have been nearly as motivated to do well, as they brought unbelievable amounts of energy with them from Vandegrift. </p>
				<p>Leading up to finals was just as exciting, of course. Thanks to some (correction: A TON) of glitter and an uh-MAZing marketing team, our pit was easily  the best at the competition (not to toot our own horns or anything...)! People would come in and chat about our robot, take a look at our CAD, pick up a QUAD X wrist band, and add a pin to our corkboard showing where they had come from for this competition. We loved hanging with all these amazing people, from team members to parents to judges. Meeting all of these people from all across the southern US was a truly incredible experience, and we can&apos;t wait to meet those that qualified at Worlds!</p>

Together we worked on perfecting double hangs, both providing the double hang for other robots and having the ability to double hang on other robots, and developing autonomous programs with other teams.hroughout the past two weeks, the teams have come in to practice with us and work on other skills.  Overall, we have been extremely successful. 
				Last night was crazy!  Disgruntled Robots and 8 Bit Bots came over and stayed until 9 pm with driver practice.  The entire QUAD X team stayed until 10:30 pm rehearsing judging, putting last finishing touches on the marketing side, and running autonomous to ensure smooth sailing. We are incredibly excited for the opportunity to compete with other amazing teams this week and we are so thankful for all the help the other ViperBots teams have given us along the way. </p>

				<h1>What a Crazy Weekend!</h1>
				<p>2/10/14</p>
				<p>As we all know, Regionals were this Friday and Saturday at the Rackspace center in San Antonio. On Friday, school was cancelled so we ended up sitting around at Vandegrift from 10 until 3 because the roads were iced up and unsafe. When we finally got to San Antonio, we had an hour to set up our pits and get ready for judging! We got it all done though, and rocked judging. Saturday was even more intense. We had to be up and ready to go by 7 (granted, that&apos;s much better than having to previously be ready by 6...)and were back in the pits by 8. The day flew by after that, with some pretty crazy qualification matches- during our last match with 6209, we got the highest score of the weekend- 384 points!! QUADX was 7161, the First Alliance Captain&apos;s, first pick, and then 6209. Unfortunately, we didn&apos;t make it past semis due to field control issues. 4545 also didn't make it all the way to the tournament finals due to an unfortunate mistake, but still rocked it! At the end of the day, QUADX  was the only ViperBots team to advance to Super Regionals, winning the Innovate Award (along with being a finalist for the Think Award). Needless to say, all ViperBots teams did AMAZING this weekend! Congrats to all who participated in this awesome competition!</p>

				<p>We&apos;ve also been working with 6209 and 4545 in driver practice, and we&apos;ve done some more double hangs! Thanks to all the practice we&apos;ve been getting with it, we should be getting that extra 50 points if we&apos;re ever paired up with them.

				<h1>Tacos and Froyo- Great Way to End the Week</h1>
				<p>1/31/2014</p>
				<p>While working in the robot room after school today, Reagan and Linnea had the idea to go out to Torchy&apos;s tacos as a team. Everybody thought it was a great idea, so after we finished our work, we went out to get some tacos. Torchy&apos;s is of course the best place ever, and we stuffed ourselves with delicious food. But not so much that we couldn&apos;t go and get some frozen yogurt at the Orange Leaf right next door once we were done. All in all, it was a great way to end a week of hard work getting ready for Regionals, and an awesome way to start our February conference break!</p>
				<p>In other news, we have finished replacing our old 3 inch wheels with 4 inch wheels, and have calculated and updated the autonomous program to accommodate that. K9 can now go a lot faster, and our autonomous works great every time!</p>

Everybody thought it was a great idea, so after we finished our work, we went out to get some tacos. Torchy&apos;s is of course the best place ever, and we stuffed ourselves with delicious food. But not so much that we couldn&apos;t go and get some frozen yogurt at the Orange Leaf right next door once we were done. All in all, it was a great way to end a week of hard work getting ready for Regionals, and an awesome way to start our February conference break!</p>
				<p>In other news, we have finished replacing our old 3 inch wheels with 4 inch wheels, and have calculated and updated the autonomous program to accommodate that. K9 can now go a lot faster, and our autonomous works great every time!</p>

				<h1>Conally Qualifier-Success!</h1>
				<p>1/29/2014</p>
				<p>The days building up to our second qualifier were a hectic ones- we&apos;ve already qualified for regionals, but our BFF&apos;s on team 7161 had yet to qualify. Our mission this weekend was to change  that. During qualification rounds, QUADX was undefeated, and in first place. We chose 7161 as our first pick during finals, and then 4847 Chrome as our second pick. With these two amazing alliance partners, we won the tournament! Amazingly, all six of the ViperBots teams are now going to regionals. Congratulations to all teams that qualified, and to all that participated in the competition!</p>

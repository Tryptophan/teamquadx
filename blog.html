			<h1>Vandegrift Kickoff</h1>
			<p>9/6/14</p>
			<p>Today, we hosted the Central Texas FTC Kickoff. Over 400 people first joined in on team bonding activities which were lead in part by Lizzy, Linnea, and Sahil. The game for the 2014-2015 year was then released at 11 and teams immediately started brainstorming designs for robots. We held a &quot;Rookie Workshop&quot; to teach the rookie teams in attendance how to be successful in marketing, hardware, and software.  After a long day of bonding and brainstorming, we all went to the ViperBots pool party where we relaxed and had a ton of fun with our team members and fellow ViperBot teams.</p>

			<p>We are so excited for the upcoming year and cannot wait to get started!!</p>

			<h1>First Build Day</h1>
			<p>9/20/14</p>
			<p>Today was the first build day of the season.  Two weeks into the season, we have finally had a chance to work for 8 hours straight.  Like any other build day, we invited rookie teams in the community, including the Texas School for the Deaf and the Canyon Ridge Middle School team Eagles Experience, to come and get help from us and take advantage of our parts closet and workshop.  Josh, Jacob and Linnea held a GitHub workshop to on how to use Git and GitHub and how to set up their own repositories. We also took our team pictures, which you can now see on &quot;The Team&quot; page of the website. </p>
